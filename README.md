## What is apricot?
Apricot is a friendly graphical interface for the analysis of label-free quantification (LFQ) data generated from data independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics datasets.

It is an R shiny wrapper on the workflow described by Yan Chen and Christopher Petzold in this [protocols.io publication](https://www.protocols.io/view/label-free-quantification-lfq-proteomic-data-analy-5qpvobk7xl4o/v2)

## How to use apricot?

### Quickstart

Currently, apricot can only be launched as a locally-hosted app. To do so, first clone this repository into your machine or download the [compacted folder](https://github.com/viana-guilherme/apricot/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) containing the entire source code. Unzip it and navigate to the project directory.

If you are an `RStudio` user, load the entire project by opening `apricot.Rproj` and then open either `ui.R` or `server.R` and click on the **run app** button that appears on the top navigation bar.

Alternatively, you can run the app directly from a bash terminal by using the command 

`R -e "shiny::runApp(~/path/to/repository, launch.browser = TRUE)"`

Both of the actions above should have the effect of opening a browser with the app homescreen. If this step fails and you do not see this screen, please contact us for troubleshooting.

### Performing an analysis

On the "run analysis" tab of the app, users are able to upload a `report.csv` file generated by Yan and Christopher's analysis pipeline, which contains abundance and metadata information for each peptide found in the samples present in the analysis.

Unique samples are then automatically identified from the .csv file and listed so that pairwise comparisons can be made according to the your interest. Currently, the app supports performing the Welch's t-Test for identifying statistically significant up/down regulated genes. It is possible to visualize log2 fold-change variations using a volcano plot, as well as perform gene ontology terms enrichment with topGO.

Results for the significance analysis then be downloaded as text files.

### Dependencies

Apricot was built in R version 4.1.3

Packages Shiny (version 1.7.4), tidyverse (version 2.0.0) and topGO (version 2.44.0) are needed for running the app.
